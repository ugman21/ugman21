what is BlueBOX/RXE?

BlueBOX will be the compositor based on AttySymbols for Real-Time animations & UI in Lazarus Austra.
RXE will be the file extension for programs based on BlueBOX, it stands for RealTime-Executable

For example, the setup program in OSr1 is setup.py, which runs in the Python shell.
This means that setup.py will need Python and will play the program step by step, very slowly.
setup.py uses the BlueBOX PIP Package instead of having it built into the system.

The setup program in Austra is setup.rxe, 
which is packaged with the BlueBOX library in mind and is developed to handle each UI element 
using the GPU instead of writing them as PNG.

Lets say i want to load a window with a button and a string of text:
In python i would load a window using the python built in window creator, then link BlueBOX with it.
I can then load a BlueBOX BUTTON png and write text over it using python.

In RXE, i would connect to the WAYLAND compositor using C, then push a BlueBOX Window to the GPU.
I can then load a BlueBOX BUTTON ontop of that window and style it however i like. 
Because this is a RealTime-Executable, i can edit the file WITHOUT having to re-launch OR recompile.
RXE can tell when an update is made to the file (CHECKSUM's) and generate a new window, replacing the old one.

Long story short, BlueBOX is a layer for RXE, Python just shows it as a png.
